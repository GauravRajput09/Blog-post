# Blog-post Project

This project is built using React and Vite, providing a minimal development environment with support for Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint rules. It is designed to streamline the development process for React applications.

## Key Features
- **React Integration**: Leverages Vite for fast and efficient development.
- **ESLint Support**: Includes some pre-configured ESLint rules for better code quality.
- **HMR**: Hot Module Replacement for seamless development experience.

## Plugins
The setup supports two official Vite plugins for React:
1. [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react): Uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
2. [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc): Uses SWC for Fast Refresh.

## Recommended Enhancements
For production applications, it is advised to expand the ESLint configuration to include TypeScript with type-aware lint rules. Refer to the [official TypeScript template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for guidance.
